summary: 'What can be better than a cup of coffee during a break? A coffee that you
  don’t have to make yourself. It’s enough to press a couple of buttons on the machine
  and you get a cup of energy; but first, we should teach the machine how to do it.
  In this project, you will work on programming a coffee machine simulator. The machine
  works with typical products: coffee, milk, sugar, and plastic cups; if it runs out
  of something, it shows a notification. You can get three types of coffee: espresso,
  cappuccino, and latte. Since nothing’s for free, it also collects the money.<br/><br/>Learn
